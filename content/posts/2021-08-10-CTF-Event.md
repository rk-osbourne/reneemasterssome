### Accepted

On Thursday, August 5, while waiting in line at the bank I saw an email notification pop up on my phone.

I had been accepted to the WiCyS Security Training Scholarship. This was great news given that I had forgotten about it. 

I had come across the scholarship in a Discord channel I was part of and decided to apply on a whim almost a month earlier. I completed the whole application process (even the essay!) on my phone while, you guessed it, waiting in line at the bank. 

This email informed me that I would be able to participate in a Catch the Flag (CTF) event starting the following day, Friday, August 6. I was grateful that this would be a national holiday in Jamaica so I was able to give the event some time. Despite the fact that I successfully [passed my Security+ Exams](https://blog.g5cybersecurity.com/congratulations-to-renee-osbourne-from-jamaica-on-passing-comptia-security/) in December 2020, I've never competed in an official CTF event. I’ve completed some rooms on [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com) and played around with [DVWA](https://dvwa.co.uk) but this would be a great opportunity to see what I could do. 

### The Process

The acceptance email had said that the CTF was browser-based and did not require a virtual machine (VM).

I mainly used Kali Linux via VMware and Windows to complete the challenges. In terms of tools, I used ZenMap/Nmap, NetCat, WireShark, the browser console and CyberChef (godsend!). 

The CTF event consumed most of my weekend. The first few challenges were simple enough. Read a little source code here, scan a network there. Fine, no biggie. Others had me questioning my life choices up to that point as I was up until 4 in the morning trying to find a key for a XOR cipher. 

In the end, what I found was that sometimes it was best to take a nap, watch a movie, bake a cake anything but sitting around the computer. Chances are the challenge you were busting your brain over for the past 4 hours will be solved within 5 minutes of returning to it and you will be tempted to throw your laptop at the wall but don’t do that because you need it and it’s not its fault. 

Can’t finish this section without the mentioning the vibrant Slack channel which was a great source of encouragement as we went through the challenges as a community.


### Results Are In

After the loss of sleep and and mornings waking up thinking about gif headers and hex code the results are in!

At 96% completion I was placed 78th out 682 participants. Top 100? I’ll take it! I should advance to the next stage based on these results but we’ll see. As for CTF events, when’s the next one? Sign me up right away. Just kidding. I need to sleep.
